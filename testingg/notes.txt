Testing
    - Testing is not about running "acceptance" tests to show that things work
    - It's about surfacing defects by causing  the system to fail (breaking it)
    - The wrong testing mindset leads to inadequate testing

Code Coverage
    - Commands Example:
        - go test ./linkparser/ -coverprofile=c.out -covermode=count 
        - go tool cover -html=c.out
